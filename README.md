My "hello" to the "world"

Howdy y'all,

I'm just a lone stranger 'round these parts.  I came here lookin' in search of great fortunes and bounty in this here part of the internets.  Word around town is, there's gold up in them there hills and I reckon I'm gonna be the one to find it.  Y'all just stay out my way and there won't be no trouble!

YEEHAW!!!!!
